          jQuery, at its core, is a Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation
          library. The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the
          elements of a Web page. jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding,
          selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. For example, jQuery
          can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain
          property (e.g. all elements with an h1 tag), changing one or more of
          its attributes (e.g. color, visibility), or making it respond to an
          event (e.g. a mouse click).
        </p>

        <p>
          jQuery also provides a paradigm for event handling that goes beyond
          basic DOM element selection and manipulation. The event assignment and
          the event callback function definition are done in a single step in a
          single location in the code. jQuery also aims to incorporate other
          highly used JavaScript functionality (e.g. fade ins and fade outs when
          hiding elements, animations by manipulating CSS properties).
        </p>

        <p>The principles of developing with jQuery are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Separation of JavaScript and HTML: The jQuery library provides
            simple syntax for adding event handlers to the DOM using JavaScript,
            rather than adding HTML event attributes to call JavaScript
            functions. Thus, it encourages developers to completely separate
            JavaScript code from HTML markup.
          </li>

          <li>
            Brevity and clarity: jQuery promotes brevity and clarity with
            features like "chainable" functions and shorthand function names.
          </li>

          <li>
            Elimination of cross-browser incompatibilities: The JavaScript
            engines of different browsers differ slightly so JavaScript code
            that works for one browser may not work for another. Like other
            JavaScript toolkits, jQuery handles all these cross-browser
            inconsistencies and provides a consistent interface that works
            across different browsers.
          </li>

          <li>
            Extensibility: New events, elements, and methods can be easily added
            and then reused as a plugin.
          </li>
        </ul>

          jQuery was originally created in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John
          Resig, influenced by Dean Edwards' earlier cssQuery library. It is
          currently maintained by a team of developers led by Timmy Willison
          (with the jQuery selector engine, Sizzle, being led by Richard
          Gibson).
        </p>

        <p>
          jQuery was originally licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.5, and relicensed
          to the MIT license in 2006. At the end of 2006, it was dual-licensed
          under GPL and MIT licenses. As this led to some confusion, in 2012 the
          GPL was dropped and is now only licensed under the MIT license.
        </p>

        <h2>Popularity</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In 2015, jQuery was used on 62.7% of the top 1 million websites
            (according to BuiltWith), and 17% of all Internet websites.
          </li>

          <li>
            In 2017, jQuery was used on 69.2% of the top 1 million websites
            (according to Libscore).
          </li>

          <li>
            In 2018, jQuery was used on 78% of the top 1 million websites.
          </li>

          <li>
            In 2019, jQuery was used on 80% of the top 1 million websites

            W3Techs).
          </li>

          <li>
            As of Feb 2020, jQuery is used by 74.4% of the top 10 million
            websites (according to W3Techs).

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Features">
        <header>Features</header>

        <p>jQuery includes the following features:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector
            engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project
          </li>

          <li>
            DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that uses elements' names
            and attributes, such as id and class, as criteria to select nodes in
            the DOM
          </li>

          <li>Events</li>

          <li>Effects and animations</li>

          <li>Ajax</li>

          <li>
            Deferred and Promise objects to control asynchronous processing
          </li>

          <li>JSON parsing</li>

          <li>Extensibility through plug-ins</li>

          <li>Utilities, such as feature detection</li>

          <li>
            Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern
            browsers, but need fallbacks for older browsers, such as
            <span class="codes">jQuery.inArray()</span> and
            <span class="codes">jQuery.each()</span>
          </li>

          <li>Cross-browser support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The jQuery library is typically distributed as a single JavaScript
          file that defines all its interfaces, including DOM, Events, and Ajax
          functions. It can be included within a Web page by linking to a local
          copy, or by linking to one of the many copies available from public
          servers. jQuery has a content delivery network (CDN) hosted by
          MaxCDN.Google in Google Hosted Libraries service and Microsoft host
          the library as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Example of linking a copy of the library locally (from the same server
          that hosts the Web page):
        </p>
        <code> &lt;script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code>

        <p>
          Example of linking a copy of the library from jQuery's public CDN:
        </p>

        <code>
          &lt;src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
          integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0="
          crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Interface">
        <header>Interface</header>

        <h2>Functions</h2>

        <p>
          jQuery provides two kinds of functions, static utility functions and
          jQuery object methods. Each has its own usage style. Both are accessed
          through jQuery's main identifier: <span class="codes">jQuery</span>.
          This identifier has an alias named <span class="codes">$</span>. All
          functions can be accessed through either of these two names.
        </p>

        <h2>Typical start-point</h2>

        <p>
          Typically, jQuery is used by putting initialization code and event
          handling functions in <span class="codes">$(handler)</span>. This is
          triggered by jQuery when the browser has finished constructing the DOM
          for the current Web page.
        </p>

        <code>
          $(function () { // This anonymous function is called when the page has
          completed loading. // Here, one can place code to create jQuery
          objects, handle events, etc. });
        </code>

        <p>or</p>
        <code>
          $(fn); // The function named fn, defined elsewhere, is called when the
          page has loaded.
        </code>

        <p>
          Historically,
          <span class="codes">$(document).ready(callback)</span> has been the de
          facto idiom for running code after the DOM is ready. However, since
          jQuery 3.0, developers are encouraged to use the much shorter
          <span class="codes">$(handler)</span> signature instead.
